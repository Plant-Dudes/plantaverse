A new IPFS Cluster release is out! [**Version 0.14.2**](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) brings improvements to handling large numbers of pins. A pin prioritization feature ensures new pins are replicated faster in the face of long pinning queues. The improvement allows flexible and balanced distribution of pins among different peers based on user-defined groups.
