## **Project Showcase: OmniLingo**

![](../assets/omnilingo-x-ipfs.jpg)

There are many educational applications for learning a new language. There are none, however, that take advantage of Web3’s capability for open-source collaboration. [OmniLingo](https://omnilingo.xyz/) is using IPFS to enable language activists, language learners, and language instructors to form their own decentralized communities for under-represented languages. Find out more about how you can try the application and maybe learn a new language [here](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-12-17-omnilingo/).

## **Brand New on IPFS**

## Want to help build the new internet?

[**Filecoin Green Program Administrator**](https://jobs.lever.co/protocol/33a795a3-a69e-4f89-82d7-3da0bd5626ce): We are searching for a Program Administrator who will help to track, manage and direct a team developing tomorrow’s environmental accounting tools. [**Filecoin Green**](https://medium.com/@filecoingreen) is a fast-growing initiative dedicated to measuring, reducing and mitigating environmental impacts within the Filecoin ecosystem and beyond. The team aims to catalyze this by enabling teams across the Filecoin ecosystem to verifiably report their emissions, and to use these data as the basis for impact reductions. **Protocol Labs**, Remote.

[**Community Manager**](https://valist.io/roles/community-manager.pdf): Valist is hiring a community manager to help expand outreach, community, and brand awareness. In this role, you will have a strong influence on our growth strategies, forge and develop great relationships with our community members and key partners, and create high quality content.

[**Head of Content**](https://jobs.lever.co/protocol/330b0744-ebea-4bc3-90de-e817b470b8cb): Protocol Labs is seeking a Head of Content to develop and execute effective content deliverables for our portfolio and ecosystem projects including Filecoin and IPFS. The ideal candidate is an exceptional writer with a proven experience in communicating blockchain and Web3 concepts to developers, non-developers, enterprises, and newcomers. **Protocol Labs**, Remote.

[**Developer Relations**](https://boards.greenhouse.io/textileio/jobs/4075619004): Textile is seeking someone to run large-scale community projects. These include amplifying our grants program to fund community projects, curating governance groups where we bring community stakeholders into our technology planning, engaging with external teams like Gitcoin and EthDenver to support large-scale developer events, and giving technical presentations at events.

[**Senior Software Engineer**](https://jobs.lever.co/protocol/3490e571-4d47-487e-a47f-b02f08668290): Distributed systems engineering lies at the center of many projects at Protocol Labs. With IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin, and other related projects, we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, more secure, distributed version of the web. This requires rigorous engineering from protocol design through all the phases of implementation. We strike a balance between pragmatism, deeply informed protocol design, and strict application of strong engineering principles. All of this happens in an environment defined by curiosity, passion, and a love for open source. **Protocol Labs**, Remote.

[**Fullstack Engineer**](https://boards.greenhouse.io/textileio/jobs/4017984004): Textile's web products and services are written primarily in Golang and TypeScript, and communicate with Textile's core gRPC services.
