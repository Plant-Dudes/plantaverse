## **Not Your Data Storage Infrastructure, Not Your NFTs**

![](../assets/ipfs-feb-8.png)

In IPFS, resilience is the way that people individually and collectively participate in the network to store and govern data. It is context specific, and requires active participation of stakeholders to govern the storage of their data. Data storage resilience could be improved by leveraging existing Web3.0 data governance frameworks, such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), to coordinate data storage infrastructure and utilization in a way that owners of data are able to govern how it is stored and used. To learn more about these concepts, read [**this piece**](https://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/not-your-storage-architecture-not) by Protocol Labs PhD Fellow, Kelsie Nabben, as she dives into how distributed storage and content addressing make end-user applications more resilient.
