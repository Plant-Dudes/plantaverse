## **Web3 Browsers for Decentralized Storage**

![](../assets/ipfs-blog-2021-12-17-web3browsers.png)

Browsers are still most users’ primary interface when they interact with the internet. In most cases, however, they’re still stuck with Web 2.0 infrastructure. This has started to change thanks to recent integrations by browsers like [**Brave**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-01-19-ipfs-in-brave/)and [**Opera**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-02-08-opera-ios-and-ipfs/) who’ve added native support for IPFS as the default protocol for decentralized storage. These developments eliminate the need for centralized gateways and pave the way for the slow but steady ongoing migration from HTTP to Web3.

## **Brand New on IPFS**

1. 4EVERLAND [**became**](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/dev-grant-spotlight-4everland-6b07da0aade6) the latest recipient of the Filecoin Foundation’s [**Dev Grant**](https://grants.filecoin.io/). The cloud computing company helps developers build Web3 applications by leveraging IPFS for stable and efficient content storage and distribution.
2. Introducing the Faber Web3 Hackathon! The event and accelerator will run from mid-February to mid-March and is welcoming IPFS builders. [**Learn more**](http://faberweb3.devpost.com/)about the event and [**apply**](http://faberweb3.devpost.com/) today.
3. Fleek’s [**Eth.Limo**](https://blog.fleek.co/posts/eth-limo-alternative-eth-link) gateway is a new decentralized alternative for resolving IPFS and ENS domain sites.
4. Read Chris Anderson’s take on NFTs and their value in this [**article**](https://thenewstack.io/nfts-in-the-uncanny-valley/) for The New Stack.

## **Around the Ecosystem**

Check out Libre Space Foundation’s interesting [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRo1BCj_4n8) explaining IPFS-tiny and how it enables new concepts at OSCW 2021.  
  
The DINPS 22 workshop at ICDS 2022 is interested in your research! Submit your proposals [**here**](https://research.protocol.ai/sites/dinps/calls/) by March 5th.   
  
HashLips NFT shared a guide on how to upload larger and multiple files to IPFS. Be sure to watch their [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOUz3ifDpR4) to learn how to do this and then pin the files using Pinata.  
  
Protocol Labs [**announced**](https://twitter.com/ProtoResearch/status/1485624717532934145?s=20) Dennis Trautwein as a new Ph.D. fellow. Along with his advisor Bela Gipp, they will investigate if and how a super-peer architecture can complement the IPFS network from a content discovery and content retrieval perspective.  
  
For a great rundown on the basics, watch gp_sec’s [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpU3R22lgOI) on how to host files on IPFS. They cover the process from installation to pinning.  
  
Blok Scout has also shared a great [**explainer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwd-dQHDvB0) on distributed file storage for anybody who’s new to IPFS.
