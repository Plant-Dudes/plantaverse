## **IPFS 2021 in Review**

![](../assets/148262638-63588f04-cdfd-4476-ba67-912fd6bd3555.jpg)

Web3 applications had a great run in 2021 as mainstream users were introduced to concepts like NFTs. This was all possible thanks to the infrastructure developments that were already there to support them with decentralized storage. Throughout the year, IPFS collaborated with projects such as OpenSea, Brave, Pinata, and Audius to make this happen. It also added important features to its Go and JavaScript implementations as well as the IPFS Cluster codebase. [Get a refresh](https://blog.ipfs.io/2022-01-11-IPFS-in-2021/) on everything that happened in 2021.

## **Brand New on IPFS**

1. Last week, the Bitflix movie NFT platform [chose](https://twitter.com/BitflixNFTs/status/1479478241459011584?s=20) IPFS for its decentralized storage needs to ensure the NFTs are safe and secure.
2. Ecosys, an open source ecology platform, is [using](https://twitter.com/octopuce_node/status/1480555606385860612?s=20) IPFS for web hosting.
3. The DINPS 2022 workshop is looking for papers related to IPFS, distributed storage, p2p networks, and edge computing. Submissions are open until March 5 with more information available on the [official website](https://research.protocol.ai/sites/dinps/calls/).
4. The Moralis + Avalanche Hackathon is hosting an IPFS and Filecoin track where participants will compete for the Best Use of IPFS or NFT.Storage for Content-Addressed Data. Register now on the [event website](https://moralis.io/avalanche-hackathon/).

## **Around the Ecosystem**

Be sure to check out developerAlly’s upcoming [workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIZNW_c6Hx4) on how to create NFTs using IPFS and Filecoin. It will take place on January 13 at the NFTHack 2022 weekend-long hackathon and summit.

The second libp2p community call happened earlier today - couldn’t make it? Be sure to stay tuned for details on the next one [here](https://discuss.libp2p.io/t/libp2p-community-calls/1157).

Watch a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YnInXG682U) on how to upload a website to an IPFS node run by Cybercon, a dedicated server provider working with decentralized websites and apps.

Find out how you can use Fleek to deploy and host a website using IPFS and connect it to a .eth ENS domain by watching Sarah Amann’s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0Drm0-ZeM).
