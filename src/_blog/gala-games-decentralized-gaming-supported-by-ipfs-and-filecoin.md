Game development is at a completely different place than where it was a decade or two ago. Today’s games are rich multimedia and art experiences, but that depth comes at a cost. All the amazing design, code, and infrastructure in these releases are requiring similar advancements in storage solutions.

As immersive games cross over the Web3 frontier, developers in the space will need tools at their disposal to organize, analyze, archive, and deploy massive amounts of data. [Gala Games](https://app.gala.games/about/) is a solution that meets these needs and helps different teams and projects develop games on chain. Its mission is to build a decentralized gaming platform not only full of great games, but also where players own their content and have full control of their digital treasures.

### The Tools that Support Growth

To build this, the platform has leveraged the technology of its Web3 peers. Its mission of empowering gamers through ownership can only be so effective if it relies on centralized Web 2.0 infrastructure.

Gala Games makes use of IPFS and Filecoin’s flexibility as [decentralized storage solutions](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/how-ipfs-works) to back up and curate data across its platform. Together, IPFS and Filecoin have established an ecosystem that requires no trust in a major corporation or data storage system to ensure that data is stored in a decentralized manner and permanently preserved. By using these services, Gala keeps even archive data entirely decentralized.

IPFS and Filecoin serve as the appropriate solutions for Gala’s large amounts of backup data. Beyond the normal needs of hosting and distributing multiple titles, games on the platform are facilitated by its [ecosystem](https://app.gala.games/nodes/ecosystem/) of over 40,000 player-owned nodes. These nodes produce massive amounts of data that need to be securely and permanently curated. Filecoin has enabled Gala Games to create backups that are [pinned](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/using-filecoin-with-ipfs/) to IPFS and replicate throughout the Filecoin ecosystem.

Both networks have also been useful in allowing Gala to build independently on its own native infrastructure due to how easily their core capabilities can be integrated into other systems. In particular, the versatility of [smart contract functionality](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/introducing-the-filecoin-virtual-machine/) on Filecoin makes it superior to traditional storage mediums.

### Empowering Tomorrow

Gala Games has big plans going forward and the team and its scope have grown fast. Its goal of delivering the highest quality of gaming experiences in a setting where players own and earn from their content is driven forward by its [engaged community](https://blog.gala.games/speaking-of-community-d5ccc7c86747) and its reliance on Web3 infrastructure solutions like IPFS and Filecoin.

2022 promises to be an exciting year for the world of gaming and all of Web3 with the developments on the Gala Games platform.
