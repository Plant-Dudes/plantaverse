Renamed from `@mr-hope/vuepress-plugin-comment` to `vuepress-plugin-comment2`. âš 

- Valine service is removed ![removed](https://img.shields.io/badge/-removed-red)

  Valine is lack of maintainence and can leak your privacy. You should use [Waline](https://waline.js.org) instead.

- Vssue is currently missing ![warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/-warning-yellow)

  Vssue is written in Vue2, and the author [meteorlxy](https://github.com/meteorlxy) has not yet made it compatable with VuePress2 yet
