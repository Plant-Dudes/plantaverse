Alphabetically organized site maps, sometimes called site indexes, are a different approach.</p><p>For use by search engines and other crawlers, there is a structured format, the XML Sitemap, which lists the pages in a site, their relative importance, and how often they are updated. This is pointed to from the robots.txt file and is typically called sitemap.xml .</p><p>Google introduced the Sitemaps protocol so web developers can publish lists of links from across their sites.</p></div>',13);function y(_,v){const o=i("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),n(r,null,[e("p",null,[p,h,e("a",u,[m,c(o)]),f]),g],64)}var b=a(d,[["render",y]]);export{b as default};
